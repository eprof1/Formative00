constants.js and Formative00

for fall 2020, students will begin on first day with Formative00 folder already uploaded to their T: drive, along with constants.js
They will have to go into constants.js and put in their first name, last name, starid.
They then go to D2l and click on 'my websites' and navigate to Formative00.html, and start working on it-most importantly to retrieve and submit their Vs2019 enterprise Product key, so that we have it in case VS/Azure Dev Tools goes berserk again.



This is the Formative00 used in all MIS classes.
It is currently (1/14/2019) the most up to date version.

should push this to github/eprof1/Formative00 sometime
